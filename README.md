### Notes:

- Replace "Describe your project here." with a brief description of your project.
- Adjust URLs (`git clone` and `localhost`/`network` URLs) based on your actual repository and development environment.
- Ensure you update any placeholder text with actual project details and instructions.
- This format keeps all sections in code blocks for easy copy-pasting into your README.md file. Adjust as needed for your specific project structure and documentation style.
